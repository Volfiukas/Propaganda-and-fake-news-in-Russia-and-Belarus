            <p>A fairly widespread idea of ​​the reasons for the stability of authoritarian regimes, such as the Russian and Belarusian, is that the state restricts access to independent information. However, Grigory Asmolov, a researcher at the Institute of Russia at King's College London, who studies media and communications, draws attention to the fact that even the citizens of Belarus, Russia and most other authoritarian countries, thanks to the Internet, have access to alternative points of view - the government just understood how it should be act in such a situation. In an interview with Meduza, Asmolov talked about how to distinguish a propaganda message from a neutral one - and how to learn how to resist a new type of propaganda.</p>
<p><b>- What do scientists call propaganda?</b></p>
<p> - There is no single answer to this question, there are hundreds of definitions. Initially, the concept of "propaganda" was associated with the dissemination of religious knowledge and did not include the aspect of manipulation, there were no negative connotations. Of the modern definitions, my favorite is the one suggested recently by colleagues at Harvard University, who published the book "Network Propaganda." Its essence is that the propagandist pursues some goal, and in order to achieve it, he tries to influence the behavior of potential audiences so that it corresponds to his goals. And for this he uses information manipulation. Propaganda tries to change a person's relationship with the outside world through information messages. Then an endless discussion begins about where there is manipulation and where not.</p>
<p><b> - Are there any undeniable examples?</b></p>
<p>- For example, the history of Cambridge Analytica . In order to influence people's behavior in the [US] elections or the UK's exit from the EU, they manipulated the audience through an individual approach - they mixed personalized political news into social media feeds that were highly likely to affect a particular person.</p>
<p><b>- How did it work?</b></p>
<p>- I heard the essence of this method from Christopher Wiley, who first told the press about this whole story with Cambridge Analytica. He is a former employee of this company. Previously, a propagandist would go on stage and say something to the crowd, trying to influence opinions. Now, due to information technology, the ability to collect and analyze personal data, it has become more effective to act differently. In fact, this speaker leaves the stage, approaches each listener and, knowing a lot about this person, whispers in his ear what will definitely effectively affect him. He collects information about the audience, and then adjusts his messages for each specific person. It's like coming on a first date and knowing, say, your partner's favorite movies - it becomes much easier to please.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I came across a startup called The Spinner that took this approach even further. He suggested targeting specific people in order to influence their decisions. For example, if you want to convince parents to buy a dog, you can order a service so that they constantly come across news related to the positive influence of animals on the development of children. The startup was banned at some point, but the essence of the capabilities of these new tools is important here. If you specially form an informational picture of a person, this makes it more comfortable for him to make the decision you need.</p>
<p><b> - Is it possible thanks to social networks?</b></p>
<p> - Yes, this is, first of all, the influence of social networks, although not only them. If earlier we received messages on TV, on the radio, read in newspapers, and then went to discuss it with our environment, today in the digital information environment we have the opportunity to immediately be active - like, comment, share messages and participate in crowdsourcing projects ... News messaging has become part of personal communications. And propaganda no longer perceives a person only as a passive audience, but tries to involve him in its reproduction. In such a situation, one can speak of “propaganda of complicity,” and this is a relatively new aspect of manipulating public opinion. The influence of propaganda is stronger when it not only offers some kind of picture of the world, but involves a person and turns him into a part of the propaganda system.</p>
<p><b>- So the Internet simplifies the way propaganda is spread?</b></p>
<p>- Traditionally, propaganda was based on the possibility of some kind of information monopoly. In the Soviet Union, all media were controlled by the state, the only possible source of "other" information - "enemy voices" on the radio, but they could be jammed. After the advent of the Internet, it became more difficult to influence public consciousness. There are models like North Korea, where external sources are completely cut off, but technically it is very difficult to implement and apply. People today have access to various sources of information.</p>
<p>Yes, there are attempts to block sites, to prohibit something, but the effect of this is minimal - information finds workarounds. And for propaganda, the question arose: how to work effectively in this new environment, where it is impossible to use a complete monopoly? The state began to learn how to compensate for the impossibility of complete control of the information space with the help of new technologies.</p>
<p><b>- And what has it learned?</b></p>
<p>- Today, the so-called "computational propaganda" is active. The concept was proposed by Philip Howard, director of the Institute for Internet Studies at Oxford University. Computational propaganda involves new technologies and new participants in the dissemination of the message. The second includes bots that increase the visibility of information.</p>
<p>The monopoly on the dissemination of information is no longer so important. In a situation of information overload and attention deficit, the most visible messages are the most influential. The algorithms that determine the visibility of information on social media react to how many people support its dissemination. Bots, on the other hand, actively comment, like and share the propagandist's messages, and, as a result, increase their visibility.</p>
<p><b>- But there is clearly a lack of alternative sources of information in Russia. Does this make Russian propaganda more effective?</b></p>
<p> - In fact, they are available in Russia, the question is the desire to receive information from them. Yes, most of the independent media have been taken over by the state over the past few years, but finding an alternative point of view on the Internet is still not difficult. Here, to a greater extent, the problem is in information literacy. People lack knowledge of how news should be consumed, how to perceive information critically. Hence the problem with the desire to get acquainted with the situation from different sides.</p>
<p><b>- That is, there is no desire to learn a different point of view, because people do not know how to distinguish a high-quality news feed from a low-quality one, and therefore do not look for an alternative?</b></p>
<p>- Yes, but not only. Finding information is a rather resource-intensive task. There are many problems in life, and critical news consumption takes effort. And people are generally inclined to passive consumption of information, when you are sitting in front of the TV, and the news itself comes to you. Now we see them on social networks, when our friends share them in the feed. Our information picture is largely shaped by our contacts, and not by a specific channel.</p>
<p>In addition, there is still formed apathy, when a person does not trust anyone at all. To achieve it is one of the goals of propaganda. An Internet user who sees that someone is endlessly arguing with someone has a feeling that no one can be trusted, all the information around is fake. People leave social networks, do not want to participate in anything. Such apathy is the effect of modern propaganda; it reduces the risks for the authorities. And this is what we also see in Russia.</p>
<p><b>- What other effects does propaganda have?</b></p>
<p>- There are three such aspects. Propaganda allows you to mobilize people for tasks related to what the manipulator wants. With this, it seems, everything is clear. Second, propaganda supports demobilization. The Internet allows hypothetical oppositionists and activists to participate in something, self-organize, and propaganda seeks to reduce the potential of the Internet and prevent some part of society from mobilizing in independent formats. This is done by creating doubt in order to mobilize. You can ask questions: do you really want to do this? Are you sure that this activity serves a good purpose, and not the interests of terrible external forces? People begin to doubt the appropriateness of what they were convinced of. In addition, by contributing to social polarization, increasing the emotional level of online conflicts and thereby destroying the bonds between people,propaganda also destroys alternative structures that could unite into something.</p>
<p><b>- How to recognize a propaganda message?</b></p>
<p>- In propaganda, attempts to manipulate are usually seen due to the emotional component and due to manipulation with the reliability of information. A message that is not propaganda initially implies the right to the opinion of another and a willingness to participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>If we talk about recent events, we can see, for example, how propaganda worked in the context of voting on amendments to the Constitution. First of all, there is a task to influence the decision. This can be achieved through certain messages, in this case associated with different amendments. For example, some gender issues were associated with the problem of the moral character of society, its well-being, and population growth. The positioning is as follows: there are so-called traditional and non-traditional relations, non-traditional relations - a problem for the development of society, if you vote this way, you will solve the problems associated with these threats. </p>
<p>Propaganda implements this idea in two ways - a simple promotion of this message and especially provocative videos in which the message is brought to the point of absurdity. I'm talking about a  video about a gay couple adopting a child . Its absurdity is effective not due to the fact that it convinces someone, but due to the creation of a very aggressive, negative communication environment around this message. The topic becomes central to the discussion, it involves a large number of people and fosters emotional conflicts as well as social polarization.</p>
<p>On the one hand, propaganda says that if you vote “yes”, you will solve a number of social problems. On the other hand, it makes it the center of attention of a large number of people, as much as possible provokes and polarizes society. And this, again, leads to the disintegration of certain social ties.</p>
<p><b>- Twenty or thirty years ago, before the Internet era, were the approaches the same?</b></p>
<p>- The approach does not change much. Propaganda is always based on a simplified model of the world - in effective propaganda messages there is a problem and there is a solution to it. Usually the target audience is invited to participate in solving the problem. The message identifies some enemies, problems, sources of instability - what causes a bad life. And what is called a "bad life" will depend on the context.</p>
<p>If we talk about the goals of manipulative messages, they are often tied to another traditional political slogan - “Divide and conquer”. The presence of propaganda on social media is causing disunity. It works like this: some topic turns out to be a stumbling block and in some way changes the structure of society. For example, in the situation with the conflict in Ukraine, control over the dissemination of information was carried out, among other things, by creating a tense atmosphere around those events. This led to the fact that people began to swear and actively remove each other from friends on social networks. So the connections that could be alternative sources of information about what was happening were disintegrated. And if horizontal ties between people on different sides of the conflict disintegrate, the monopoly of state sources of information becomes stronger.</p>
<p>Fake news, in this sense, doesn't have to strongly influence your point of view. Often these are just provocations on a hot topic to make people quarrel and divide into groups depending on their opinions on this matter: if you think so, you cannot be my friend, get out of my feed. And this may apply to our classmates, fellow students, colleagues, relatives.</p>
<p><b>- How does this affect the structure of society?</b></p>
<p>- Today's propaganda is dangerous and effective, because it not only forms an opinion around a topic - it changes the structure of society, leads to the disintegration of social ties. This works especially well on social media, because their device is conducive to such battles.</p>
<p>It is also important that there are not enough protective mechanisms in Russia that allow us to separate personal communication and political position. Studies show that if a person in Russia has different political views or, in principle, a different opinion on some important social topic, and this suddenly becomes obvious within the framework of communication in social networks, this often leads to the exclusion of a person from the social circle by those who hold a different opinion. In many other sociopolitical systems, norms have been formed for centuries, which is not very decent to discuss politics, because opinions can be different and this will lead to controversy. In order to preserve friendship, cooperation, relationships, it is better not to raise these topics. These defense mechanisms work in part on social media as well.</p>
<p>In other societies, there are situations when there are people with different political opinions in the family, and they get along well. In Russia, this is especially often a problem at the generational level, when older and younger relatives live in different information environments, and this leads to very serious discord. And here, rather, the responsibility of children is to develop protective mechanisms that will allow them to communicate normally with relatives living in a different information environment.</p>
<p><b>- But it seems that something similar happened before: people fifty years ago could discuss something in the kitchen, quarrel and stop communicating. What is the difference between today's situation?</b></p>
<p> - The phenomenon of Soviet Moscow cuisine is indeed compared to the role of the Internet as an alternative public space. But the number of people who could gather in the kitchen is significantly less than the number of friends in your friend feed. The scale of involvement in discussion of provocative topics is different.</p>
<p>People of the chosen circle were sitting in the kitchen, and in social networks there are weak and strong connections, different degrees of acquaintance. Researchers describe the emergence of a new discussion topic as an explosion of political heterogeneity ( heterogeneity - Meduza's comment ) - disunity due to disagreements. Often you think that among your followers on social networks there are people who think the same way as you, and suddenly some political or gender issue arises that causes discussion - and you will find out that you have people in your friends who think about it completely different. In the situation of Moscow kitchens, this did not work, because the space of personal communication and the space of the media were separated [from each other].</p>
<p>Plus, it's much easier on social media to delete someone, disconnect. If earlier, in order to break the connection with someone, you had to throw down the glove, not shake hands, write a public letter, today, due to the Internet, it is much easier to break the connection with another person. And in his Russian segment, such a gap has become a declarative way to say that I don't want to communicate with this person. We see a lot of posts about how someone removed someone from their friends. Or such calls: if you think so, you yourself will be removed from my friends. And the symbolic removal of a person in social networks because of some discussion topic greatly affects our offline relationship.</p>
<p>Modern propaganda can successfully quarrel us with people whose opinions differ from ours. This increases the ability of the state to influence our views, because we are losing alternative sources of information.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is so important that our social networks are formed heterogeneously, when there are people with different opinions among our contacts. If each discussion topic leads to the fact that we delete someone, our social network automatically becomes more and more homogeneous, we receive only the information that matches our opinion.</p>
<p><b>- Is this all a plus for state propagandists?</b></p>
<p>- In fact, they also have a serious danger - violation of the feedback mechanism. Researchers pay attention to the phenomenon when a propagandist begins to believe in his own propaganda, a picture of the world constructed by himself. This leads to a disconnect from reality and making the wrong decisions. That is, while propaganda seeks to guarantee control over society, this kind of self-deception is fraught with the opposite - a serious crisis that cannot be controlled in the information field, which leads to the collapse of the political system. We can see this, in particular, on the example of Belarus, where Alexander Lukashenko was clearly not ready to be booed right at the plant, where he had arrived with the expectation of making a convincing speech. Such a collision of a propagandist with reality is a situation of shock, and if we are talking about an authoritarian leader,then the consequences can be unpredictable.</p>

<center>Workers demand resignation of Lukashenka</center>
<p><b>- That is, it may happen that the regime destroys itself by its own manipulations?</b></p>
<p>- “Destroy” is probably a strong saying, but such an information policy increases the risks of destabilizing society. And this can lead to consequences that are opposite to the goals of propaganda.</p>

              </div>

                <center><h5>Reports about alleged attempts in Belarus to do away with Russian headlined the news on August 30, 2020 for Russia's state-run Rossia-1 TV channel.</h5></center>
            </div>  
<p>As Belarus and Russia move to strengthen their ties in response to ongoing Belarusian protests against election fraud, the two countries’ state-controlled TV channels have begun to mirror each other’s content to warn against the risk of a supposed Maidan-style revolution in Belarus and convince viewers that NATO member Poland plans a Belarusian-territory grab.</p>
<p>The synced coverage began after Belarus’ August 9 presidential election, when protesters took to the streets throughout the country to denounce election fraud, police violence, and to call for a fresh vote.</p>
<p>But it intensified after President Alyaksandr Lukashenka announced on August 27 that he had invited employees from the Kremlin-financed television network RT to help out at state broadcasters. In outrage at the police treatment of protesters and at their own channels’ coverage of the demonstrations, employees at these stations began to resign or go on strike in late August.</p>
<p>One anonymous employee of state TV channel Belarus-1 told the Russian news outlet <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/politics/31/08/2020/5f44ce2e9a794742baeada1b">RBC</a> that the station had been effectively “paralyzed” for lack of technical staff.</p>
<center><div class="everything" style="height:250px;"></div></center>

<div class="smalltitle3">
    <center><h5>At a rally by striking workers outside Belarus' National State Television and Radio, a participant holds a poster that reads "Everything is seen!"</h5></center>
</div>

<p>The Belarusian government sees the media message about the protests as a matter of national security: It has detained, <a href="https://en.currenttime.tv/a/30773283.html">deported</a>, <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/belarus-detention--journalists-rferl-bbc-reuters-intimidation-accreditation-revoked-protests/30810015.html"> scrapped the accreditation</a> of multiple journalists reporting on the protests for foreign media organizations, including Current Time and its parent organization, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.</p>
<p>To ensure Belarus’ TV channels, all state-run, stayed on the air and on message about the protests, Lukashenka looked to teams of employees from Russia’s Kremlin-run RT, often described as a propaganda network.</p>
<p>But the cooperation did not stop at technical or editorial support alone.</p>
<p><b>The ‘Maidan’ Menace</b></p>
<p>For years, Russian state TV channels have scared Russians with the word “Maidan,” used as a synonym for political instability and street-born revolutions.</p>
<p>On August 27, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSJuGv3oxlc">Mykola Azarov</a>, a former Ukrainian prime minister now living in Russia, echoed that message, telling Belarus’ state-run ONT that the ongoing protests remind him of “the preparation” for Ukraine’s “first Maidan;” the 2004-2005 demonstrations against fraudulent presidential election results that eventually led to a change of government.</p>
<p>The 72-year-old Azarov’s own Maidan experience dates to 2014, when protests over Kyiv’s decision to scuttle a cooperation agreement with the European Union led to Azarov’s resignation and his departure, along with his patron, ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, for Russia.</p>
<p>Drawing on that background, Azarov underlined to Belarusians that “It’s completely clear that the Western special services began preparing long ago for Belarus’ elections.”</p>
<p>Eventually, he speculated, that will lead to bans on the use of Russian within Belarus as a way to sever the country’s ties with Russia.</p>
<p>Concrete proof of such “preparations” may not exist, but the claims alone are familiar now to both Belarusian and Russian TV audiences.</p>
<p><b>The ‘Hand Of The West’</b></p>
<p>Belarusian authorities routinely appear on TV to speak about “the hand of the West” – a turn of phrase that signifies that Western intelligence agencies are running the demonstrations as a covert operation. Russia, too, has long held that large-scale protests in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan that led to the departure of relatively Moscow-friendly leaders rank among such operations.</p>
<p>In Belarus’ case, Belarusian and Russian broadcasters assert that the protests are intended to secure the “partition of Belarus” – a reference to the country’s western region of Hrodna, which was part of Poland from 1921 until 1939.</p>
<p>On August 27, ONT took aim at <a href="https://twitter.com/1972tomek/status/1296815287740792832">a tweet by Polish journalist Tomasz Sommer</a>, editor of the conservative Najwyższy Czas! magazine, that termed it “completely obvious” that Hrodna should return to Poland if Belarus collapses.</p>
<p>“And we’re still trying to be correct and are embarrassed to say that they’re rudely interfering in Belarus’ domestic affairs,” ONT Chairman of the Board Marat Markov commented on air.</p>
<p>Lukashenka as well has warned of a Polish takeover of Hrodna, should Belarus become unstable – an accusation that Polish presidential aide Krzysztof Szczerski has rejected as “unfounded,” “unacceptable,” and “propaganda.”</p>
<p>But his remarks did nothing to dissuade Russia’s government broadcasters.</p>
<p>Two days after Szczerski’s August 28 interview with Polish public radio, Moscow’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLefhRHfB1c&feature=youtu.be">Channel One</a> included Sommer’s words as part of a week-in-review report about Belarus’ protests.</p>
<p>Following ONT’s lead, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2RV7g2aBJM">Rossia-1</a>, another Russian state TV channel, declared that “Polish radicals already are openly dividing up Belorussia, declaring that Hrodna should go to Poland.”</p>
<p>On August 31, the channel mentioned U.S. military training exercises near the Belarusian border in Poland, a NATO member, as part of another report about these alleged plans.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg already had rejected the notion of the Alliance’s armed intervention in Belarus – a theory touted by Lukashenka as well.</p>
<p>But, already, like a link chain, the Belarusian-Russian media claim of Polish designs on Belarusian territory has become joined to another supposed threat.</p>
<p><b>The Russian Language ‘Under Threat’</b></p>
<p>Aside from speculation about Poland, Belarusian and Russian channels are now focusing on what they describe as Belarusian opposition plans to ban the use of Russian and close all Russian-language schools.</p>
<p>Such claims also have marked Russian media coverage of Ukraine, particularly related to the disputed eastern Donbas region, which has a large ethnic Russian population.</p>
<p>Belarus’ official languages include both Belarusian and Russian. Surveys suggest that Russian ranks as the primary language of the vast majority of the country’s population of some 9.5 million.</p>
<p>But those details did not give pause to Rossia-1.</p>
<p>In an August 28 interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT87yVl2Wps">Youtube</a>, former Belarusian President Stanislau Shushkevich (1991-1994) had called for an end to Russian’s status as Belarus’ second official language, blaming the government for stamping out Belarusian culture.</p>
<p>Shushkevich, who signed the December 1991 accords with Russia and Ukraine that dissolved the Soviet Union, lambasted Lukashenka’s iron-fisted rule and described the protests as an attempt to restore justice.</p>
<p>That apparently helped bring Shushkevich to Rossia-1’s attention.</p>
<p>“Under Shushkevich in the 90s, they imposed the Belarusian language on people,” the station incorrectly informed viewers on August 30. “And closed Russian-language schools by force so that there are almost none left.”</p>
<p>“What’s happening in our country is a usual Eastern European color revolution,” Belarusian political analyst Yury Shevtsov commented to Rossia-1. “This means that, at some point, the question of distancing from Russia through language will come up.”</p>
<p>The next day, August 31, Belarus’ ONT had a report that reinforced that message, drawing on Ukraine’s 2014 EuroMaidan protests.</p>
<p>Referring to a May 2, 2014 building fire that killed 48 people during clashes in Odesa, one Vadim Borisyuk, introduced as a Belarusian “volunteer,” asserted that “nationalists” had “simply burned people because they wanted to speak Russian, because they wanted stability.”</p>
<p>Such accusations are a mainstay of state-run Russian media reports against the EuroMaidan uprising. EuroMaidan supporters, however, blame allegedly “pro-Russia” protesters for the deaths.</p>
<p>That view, however, was not shared by ONT.</p>
<p><b>A Flag That Signals Fascism?</b></p>
<p>Like ONT, state-controlled Russian media routinely depicts supporters of Ukraine’s Maidan protests as “nationalists” or “fascists.” Borisyuk, the man interviewed by ONT, provided a way to extend that description to Belarusian protesters.</p>
<p>The police who picked up his Belarusian grandfather during Nazi Germany’s 1941-1944 occupation of Belarus, he recounted to the Belarusian state broadcaster, wore white-red-white armbands like the flags that Belarusian protesters carry today.</p>
<p>“I never expected that this would be in the streets of Belarus, that they would carry the flags, not understanding what flags they are; flags that, personally for me, are just associated with the accomplices of the fascists, who were here in Belarus.”</p>
<p>The white-and-red horizontal triband was first adopted by the independent Belarusian Democratic Republic formed in 1918, after the collapse of the Russian Empire. The republic had ended by 1919, after German occupying forces withdrew and the Bolsheviks came to power.</p>

    <center><h5>A woman waves the former Belarusian national flag from a rooftop as Belarusian protesters march to Minsk's Independence Square on August 23, 2020.
    </h5></center>
</div>
<br>
<p>But Russia’s Channel One had its own backgrounder.</p>
<p>In its telling, “the republic sank into oblivion” after Belarus’ “return" and the Soviet Union's formation. The white-and-red flag, it emphasized, was used by Belarusian “collaborators” with Nazi forces during World War II.</p>
<p>Supporters of Belarus’ protests know that history, but point to the flag’s more recent and widespread use – as Belarus’ national flag after the country regained independence in 1991.</p>
<p>A referendum on President Lukashenka's proposal of a return to the red-and-green Soviet-era flag led to its demise four years later.</p>
<p><b>A Friend In Need</b></p>
<p>Though before the presidential elections, President Lukashenka had warned that <a href="https://en.currenttime.tv/a/30755623.html">Moscow intended to spark unrest</a> in Belarus, he now expresses only gratitude for the new collaboration between Belarusian and Russian state channels.</p>
<p>“You understand how important you were to us during this difficult period," he commented to an RT reporter on September 1, two days after a demonstration of tens of thousands in Minsk. "I am grateful for this support," he said.</p>
<p>How long that gratitude will last, however, is unclear. A "popular" question now among Russian media, wrote Kommersant political commentator Dmitry Drize on September 4, is whether Lukashenka is again "leading its ally by the nose."</p>
<p>But for such doubts, the Belarusian leader had a ready answer -- at least for RT: "I have never turned away from Russia," he told the network.</p>
